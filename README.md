# Finance Tracker

This application was created to help users track and view their expenses. Users can create expenses, edit, and delete them, while the application summarizes the amounts in a visually appealing way. The idea for this app was inspired by the use of Google Sheets -the user wanted something more visually interesting when viewing a table of their financial activities.

## How It's Made
This application was built with React. It uses NextUI (now HeroUI) UI library to achieve a uniform appearance of the components used, such as tables and chips. The application was written with TypeScript, and Jest was used for testing.
